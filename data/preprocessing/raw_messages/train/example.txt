Yeah, it's on the moon! They've set up a special chess arena in one of the lunar craters.

Oh, they've got this new teleportation technology. You just step into a booth, and poof, you're on the moon.

Well, the reigning champion is an AI named QuantumMind. It's been undefeated for the past decade.

Rumor has it, there's this mysterious grandmaster who's challenging QuantumMind. No one knows their identity yet.
